Which mathematical specialist inspired the original 12 Rings logo?


Solution: We are asked to find the mathematician who inspired the logo. The logo is a ring of 12 circles that are tangent to each other. We can google tangent circles and see what we can find from there.

Here, we see that there are 2 possibilities. Steiner or Pappus. After reading both articles, we realize that Pappus chains do not match the logo but Steiner chains do.


Answer: Steiner
