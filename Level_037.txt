-Level 37/144:
Inside the arcade domain of 12 lies a call to action. Follow it.


Solution: We are told to go inside some domain and follow their actions. After looking around and trying different combinations of websites, we stumble upon "arcade.the12rings.com".

Upon entering the website, we find out that we have reached the wrong domain. Trying some more combinations leads us to find "arcade12.com".

This site tells us to connect with the ringmaster's machine to demonstrate wisdom. We are then told that the machine is equal to a twelve digit number.

Upon further inspection, we recognize that it is a phone number and that the first 2 digits, 44, represent the mobile telephone prefix for the UK.

After calling the number, we are tasked to enter the key. The website tells us to print ('+')(machine). After entering the key, some morse code is played.

Recording it down, we got: "- .-- ---". We can translate this to get "TWO".


Answer: 2
