-Level 40/144:
A distinctive doctrine of being involved leads you to a domain where this question lives. There's a clue beside the ribbons of colour in the secretsof.the12rings.com


Solution: We are told to find a website and to answer the question on the website.

The distinctive doctrine of being involved leads us to the term "involvism".

Going to involvism.com, we see some text saying look deeper. Scrolling down, we see some decrypted / random text and then at the very bottom, we see a filename to an image. 

The problem tells us to look deeper so let's take a look at the source code. We see a comment on the second line saying "Which group of people link 1.4.67 to an automotive training video?" This seems like the question we need to figure out.

Maybe, the gibberish string and the filename may help us. Going to http://www.involvism.com/zz28874_coversecret.png, we discover a png of the Anonymous logo.

Let's download the image and check for any steganography. After playing around, we figure out that when we use the gibberish text as the password, we get the following string.

"When one door closes, another opens."

Let's go back to the question. The first part asks us to connect 1.4.67. This looks like a date of some sort.

After doing some research about famous events and things that happened on that day, we discover that a band called The Doors released their debut album on that day.


Answer: The Doors
