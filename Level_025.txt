-Level 25/144:
12 o'clock Tomoe posted by Nirajan on 12FB/Inside


Solution: We are asked to find a post by Nirajan on the Facebook Page or on the Inside Forums and to identify the Tomoe at the 12 o'clock position. We can go to Narajan's post history and get the following image.

After doing a reverse image search, we realize that these are Tomoe's from Naruto. We can go through the Narutopedia and look for the specific Tomoe.
