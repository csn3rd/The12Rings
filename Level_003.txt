-Level 3/144:
What colour and shape does this produce? (sqrt(cos(x))*cos(200x)+sqrt(abs(x))-0.7)*(4-x*x)^0.01, sqrt(9-x^2), -sqrt(9-x^2) from -4.5 to 4.5

Solution: We are given a set of equations and are told to find the color and shape of the graph. We can use the google grapher to help us graph.
